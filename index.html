            <p>Mei Qiu, with his tufted ears and regal gaze, is an 8-year-old Maine Coon who carries the grandeur of his breed. His impressive size is only overshadowed by his gentle nature, and his voice, a melodious blend of chirps and trills, frequently fills the household.</p>
            <p>But, like any cat, Mei Qiu has his playful side. The subtlest rustle of a string can ignite his kitten-like energy, leading to hours of enthralling play and captivating acrobatics.</p>

            <h2>Cheeto (Chicken)</h2>
            <img src="images/cheeto1.jpg" alt="Orange cat sitting next to my friends feet" width="400">
            <p>
                Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and
                tries to get outside every single day. If he isnâ€™t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven
                foot tall cat tree and sleeping.
            </p >
            <p>
                Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like
                a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own
                name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.
